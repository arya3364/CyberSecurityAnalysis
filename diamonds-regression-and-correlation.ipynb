    "What an r-squared value of .849 means is that 84.9% of the variation in the output variable can be explained by the input variable. In other words,the there is a strong positive relationship between the carat of a diamond and the price of a diamond, which can be attributed due to having an r-squared value of .849. This also means that our original hypothesis was indeed correct that there is a relationship between the carat of a diamond and the price of a diamond. This makes sense because as I may have mentioned earlier, the carat of a diamond does generally tend to be more expensive the higher the value of the carat is."

    "Next up I would like to perform a correlation on both the variables price of a diamond and the carat of a diamond. A correlation is the measure of how closely related two variables are to each other. Specifically we are going to be looking at both Person's and Spearman's correlation. Pearson's correlation is the strength of the linear relationship between two variables, so somewhat similar to regression. Spearman's correlation measures the strength and direction of monotonic (less-restrictive) association between two variables."

This is a very strong correlation, thus indicating that there is a strong positive relationship between the two variables carat of a diamond and the price of a diamond. Which means that as the carat of a diamond increases the price of the diamond increases as well. This result gives us more confirmation with the results of our previous linear regression test."
