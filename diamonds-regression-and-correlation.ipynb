In other words,the there is a strong positive relationship between the carat of a diamond and the price of a diamond, which can be attributed due to having an r-squared value of .849. This also means that our original hypothesis was indeed correct that there is a relationship between the carat of a diamond and the price of a diamond. This makes sense because as I may have mentioned earlier, the carat of a diamond does generally tend to be more expensive the higher the value of the carat is."

A correlation is the measure of how closely related two variables are to each other. Specifically we are going to be looking at both Person's and Spearman's correlation. Pearson's correlation is the strength of the linear relationship between two variables, so somewhat similar to regression. Spearman's correlation measures the strength and direction of monotonic (less-restrictive) association between two variables."
